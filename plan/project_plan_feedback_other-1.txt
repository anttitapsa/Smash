Super Smash- like

All in all a very convincing plan. All the required information is present, ingame features, technical execution and plan are all described well.
There could be a slightly more detailed description of how the program works outside the game space, or if there is anything. (How the program work requirement on the project plan)
The schedule, division of labour and techical structure are laid out just with enough precision to account for changes in knowledge and other obstacles.

Pretty decent, a soft 5/5
